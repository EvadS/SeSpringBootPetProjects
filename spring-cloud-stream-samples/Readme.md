## KTable VsKStream
--
To clear one thing up, all Kafka topics are stored as a stream
when we want to consume that topic, we can either consume it as a table or a stream. 

KTable берет поток и сокращает его до уникальных записей
In truth, everything is a stream and KTables are an abstraction over that stream
