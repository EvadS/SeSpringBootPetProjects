* [Testing MVC Web Controllers with Spring Boot and @WebMvcTest](https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-web-controller-test/)


The two most important annotations (consider learning them first) are:

* @WebMvcTest to effectively test your web-layer with MockMvc
* @DataJpaTest to effectively test your persistence layer
There are also annotations available for more niche-parts of your application:

* @JsonTest to verify JSON serialization and deserialization
* @RestClientTest to test the RestTemplate
and @DataMongoTest to test MongoDB-related code
